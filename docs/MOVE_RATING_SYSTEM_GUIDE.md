# Smash Ultimate Move Rating System

## üéØ Overview

Based on our neural network analysis results, I've created a comprehensive move rating system that evaluates each move across 8 key dimensions that determine competitive viability. Every move in the character-data-bundle now includes detailed ratings and analysis.

## üìä Rating System Components

### Core Rating Factors (Weighted by Neural Network Importance)

1. **Speed (29.2% weight)** - Most Important Factor
   - Based on startup frames with exponential decay
   - Frame 1 = 100 rating, Frame 10 = 36, Frame 20 = 13
   - Fast moves are exponentially more valuable

2. **Safety (21.5% weight)** - Second Most Important
   - Based on shield advantage and frame data
   - Positive shield advantage = higher rating
   - Accounts for startup and endlag penalties

3. **Combo Potential (10.1% weight)**
   - Based on damage, shield stun, and frame data
   - Fast moves with good damage get higher ratings
   - Essential for advantage state

4. **Kill Power (10.1% weight)**
   - Based on damage with move type multipliers
   - Smash attacks (1.5x), Specials (1.3x), Aerials (1.2x)
   - Critical for securing stocks

5. **Endlag (11.6% weight)**
   - Based on endlag frames with exponential decay
   - Lower endlag = exponentially higher rating
   - Affects combo potential and safety

6. **Frame Efficiency (8.2% weight)**
   - Damage per frame ratio
   - Measures move efficiency
   - Important for resource management

7. **Damage (5.7% weight)**
   - Raw damage normalized to 0-100 scale
   - Direct correlation with move effectiveness

8. **Versatility (3.6% weight)**
   - Based on move type and usage patterns
   - Jabs, Tilts, and Specials get higher versatility ratings
   - Accounts for move utility

## üèÜ Tier Classification System

- **S Tier (80-100)**: Excellent moves - Game-changing abilities
- **A Tier (70-79)**: Very good moves - Strong competitive tools  
- **B Tier (60-69)**: Good moves - Solid competitive options
- **C Tier (50-59)**: Average moves - Decent but situational
- **D Tier (0-49)**: Below average moves - Limited use cases

## üìà Current Rating Statistics

### Overall Distribution
- **Total Moves Rated**: 2,717 across all characters
- **Average Rating**: 30.11 (D Tier)
- **Highest Rated Move**: Robin's Arcthunder (Vortex) - 70.3 (A Tier)
- **Lowest Rated Move**: Various weak moves - 3.74 (D Tier)

### Tier Distribution
- **S Tier**: 0 moves (0.0%) - No moves reach elite status
- **A Tier**: 1 move (0.0%) - Robin's Arcthunder only

5. **Ridley - Space Pirate Rush**: 66.7 (B) - Powerful command grab
6. **Luigi - Up B (Super Jump Punch, Air)**: 66.5 (B) - Strong aerial recovery
7. **Kazuya - Up Air**: 64.6 (B) - Excellent aerial attack
8. **Lucina - Up B (Dolphin Slash)**: 63.6 (B) - Strong recovery option
9. **Marth - Up B (Dolphin Slash)**: 63.6 (B) - Same as Lucina's
10. **Captain Falcon - Side B, Air**: 63.1 (B) - Strong aerial approach option

## üìã How to Use the Rating System

### Accessing Move Ratings

Each move in the `rated-character-data-bundle.json` now includes:

```json
{
  "id": "character-move-name",
  "name": "Move Name",
  "type": "move_type",
  "startupFrames": 5,
  "damage": 12.0,
  "rating": {
    "overall_rating": 45.2,
    "tier": "C",
    "component_ratings": {
      "speed": 60.65,
      "safety": 25.0,
      "combo_potential": 15.0,
      "kill_power": 40.0,
      "frame_efficiency": 12.0,
      "endlag": 35.2,
      "damage": 40.0,
      "versatility": 70
    },
    "weights_used": { /* Neural network weights */ }
  }
}
```

### Character-Level Analysis

Each character also includes a move summary:

```json
{
  "moves": [/* all rated moves */],
  "move_summary": {
    "total_moves": 30,
    "average_rating": 32.8,
    "best_rating": 58.4,
    "worst_rating": 12.1,
    "tier_distribution": {
      "S": 0, "A": 0, "B": 2, "C": 8, "D": 20
    },
    "best_move": {
      "name": "Up B",
      "rating": 58.4,
      "tier": "C"
    },
    "worst_move": {
      "name": "Jab 1",
