# üéÆ SmashMoves - Exclusive Comparison System

## üìã Overview

I have successfully created the exclusive comparison board system you requested with three interconnected pages that work together to provide a comprehensive move comparison and tier list experience.

## üöÄ Pages Created

### 1. **comparison.html** - Exclusive Move Comparison
- **Purpose**: Compare two random moves of the same type
- **Features**:
  - Random move selection from same move type
  - User choice tracking (Move 1, Move 2, or Tie)
  - BTL model prediction comparison
  - Session statistics and agreement tracking
  - Real-time BTL model analysis

### 2. **index.html** - Tier List Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Main dashboard displaying tier-list.html results
- **Features**:
  - User choice statistics overview
  - Recent activity tracking
  - Move type analysis
  - Quick access to all features
  - Real-time data updates

### 3. **tier-list.html** - BTL Model Results
- **Purpose**: Display tier lists based on user choices and BTL model
- **Features**:
  - Three ranking types: User Choice, Neural Network, Hybrid
  - Move type filtering
  - Comprehensive move analysis
  - BTL confidence metrics
  - User choice pattern analysis

## üß† BTL Model Implementation

### User Choice Tracking
- **Data Storage**: All user choices saved to localStorage
- **Choice Types**: Move 1 wins, Move 2 wins, or Tie
- **BTL Prediction**: Real-time comparison with model predictions
- **Agreement Tracking**: Measures how often users agree with BTL model

### Ranking Algorithms
1. **User Choice BTL Ranking**: Based purely on user choices
2. **Neural Network Ranking**: Based on trained model ratings
3. **Hybrid Ranking**: 70% user choices + 30% neural network

### BTL Model Features
- **Convergence Algorithm**: Iterates until stable results
- **Multi-Attribute Analysis**: Speed, safety, damage, endlag, rating
- **Confidence Scoring**: Measures prediction certainty
- **Real-time Updates**: Rankings update as users make choices

## üéØ Key Features

### Random Move Selection
- **Same-Type Filtering**: Only compares moves of identical types
- **Character Diversity**: Random selection across all characters
- **Balanced Comparisons**: Ensures fair matchups
- **No Repetition**: Avoids comparing same moves repeatedly

### User Choice System
- **Three Options**: Choose Move 1, Move 2, or declare Tie
- **BTL Comparison**: Shows model prediction vs user choice
- **Agreement Tracking**: Measures user-model alignment
- **Session Statistics**: Real-time progress tracking

### Tier List Generation
- **Dynamic Rankings**: Updates based on user choices
- **Multiple Views**: User, Neural, and Hybrid rankings
- **Move Type Filtering**: Separate lists for each move type
- **Comprehensive Data**: Frame data, ratings, and user records

## üìä Data Flow

```
User Makes Choice ‚Üí Stored in localStorage ‚Üí BTL Model Updates ‚Üí Tier Lists Refresh
```

### Data Persistence
- **localStorage**: User choices persist across sessions
- **Real-time Sync**: Updates across all open tabs
- **Cross-page Integration**: Dashboard reflects comparison activity

## üéÆ Usage Workflow

### For Users
1. **Start at index.html** - View dashboard and statistics
2. **Go to comparison.html** - Make move comparisons
3. **Return to tier-list.html** - See updated rankings
4. **Repeat** - Build comprehensive BTL model data

### For Analysis
1. **User Choices** - Track human preferences
2. **BTL Predictions** - Compare with statistical model
3. **Agreement Rates** - Measure model accuracy
4. **Tier Evolution** - Watch rankings change over time

## üîß Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
comparison.html          # Exclusive comparison page
comparison.css           # Comparison page styling
comparison.js            # Comparison logic and BTL model
index.html              # Dashboard page
index.css               # Dashboard styling
index.js                # Dashboard logic and statistics
tier-list.html          # Tier list display page
tier-list.css           # Tier list styling
tier-list.js            # Tier list generation and BTL ranking
```

### BTL Model Components
- **Pairwise Comparisons**: Based on move attributes
- **Convergence Algorithm**: Iterative score calculation
- **Normalization**: Scores sum to 1 for probability interpretation
- **Confidence Metrics**: Measure prediction certainty

### Data Integration
- **Neural Network Data**: Uses existing rated-character-data-bundle.json
- **User Choice Storage**: localStorage for persistence
- **Real-time Updates**: Cross-page data synchronization
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## üìà Statistics and Analytics

### User Statistics
- **Total Comparisons**: Count of all user choices
- **Agreement Rate**: Percentage agreement with BTL model
- **Move Types Analyzed**: Number of different move types compared
- **Most Compared Type**: Move type with most user data

### BTL Model Metrics
- **Confidence Scores**: Measure of prediction certainty
- **Convergence Rate**: How quickly model stabilizes
- **Agreement Patterns**: User vs model alignment trends
- **Ranking Stability**: Consistency of tier list positions

## üéØ Move Types Supported

All major move types are supported:
- **Ground Attacks**: Jab, Forward Tilt, Up Tilt, Down Tilt, Dash Attack
- **Smash Attacks**: Forward Smash, Up Smash, Down Smash
- **Aerial Attacks**: Neutral Air, Forward Air, Back Air, Up Air, Down Air
