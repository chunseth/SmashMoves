## üìÅ Files Created

### Core Application Files
- `move-comparison-board.html` - Main HTML interface
- `move-comparison-board.css` - Complete styling and responsive design
- `move-comparison-board.js` - JavaScript logic with BTL model implementation

### Documentation
- `MOVE-COMPARISON-BOARD-README.md` - Comprehensive user guide
- `MOVE-COMPARISON-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Demo and Testing
- `btl-model-demo.py` - Python demonstration of BTL model
- Working HTTP server setup for testing

## üß† BTL Model Technical Details

### Algorithm Implementation
- **Convergence**: Iterates until score changes < 1e-6
- **Max Iterations**: 100 iterations maximum
- **Normalization**: Scores sum to 1 for probability interpretation
- **Weighted Attributes**: 5 factors with different importance levels

### Comparison Attributes
1. **Speed (30% weight)**: Startup frames (lower is better)
2. **Safety (25% weight)**: Shield advantage (higher is better)  
3. **Damage (20% weight)**: Raw damage output (higher is better)
4. **Endlag (15% weight)**: Recovery frames (lower is better)
5. **Rating (10% weight)**: Overall neural network rating (higher is better)

### Demo Results
The BTL model successfully ranked 5 sample moves:
1. **Mario Jab 1** (BTL Score: 0.2777) - Fastest startup
2. **Mario Neutral Air** (BTL Score: 0.2368) - High rating + speed
3. **Mario Forward Tilt** (BTL Score: 0.2164) - Balanced attributes
4. **Mario Forward Air** (BTL Score: 0.1509) - Good damage
5. **Mario Forward Smash** (BTL Score: 0.1182) - High damage but slow

## üéØ Key Features Demonstrated

- Shows overall ratings (0-100 scale)
- Component breakdowns (speed, safety, etc.)
- Based on trained model predictions

### 4. Tier List Generation
